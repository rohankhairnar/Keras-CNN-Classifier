# Keras-CNN-Classifier
Basic CNN for image classification using Keras

Mountain Bike and Road Bike Classifier

Built CNN from scratch (i.e without using any pretrained model – like Inception).
Used CV2 for OpenCV functions – Image resizing, grey scaling.
The Neural Network is designed using Keras library.
Code developed using Jupyter Notebook – Python (ipynb)

Referred to https://github.com/MicrocontrollersAndMore/TensorFlow_Tut_2_Classification_Walk-through
which is developed using TensorFlow.
